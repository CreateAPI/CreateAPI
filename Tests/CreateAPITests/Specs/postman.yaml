  title: Postman API
  description: "The Postman API allows you to programmatically access data stored in Postman account with ease.\n\nThe easiest way to get started with the API is to click the **fork** button to fork this collection to your own workspace and use Postman to send requests.\n\n\n# Overview\n\n1. You need a valid <a href=\"#authentication\">API Key</a> to send requests to the API endpoints. You can get your key from the [integrations dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys).\n\n1. The API has an access <a href=\"#rate-limits\">rate limit</a> applied to it.\n\n1. The Postman API will only respond to secured communication done over HTTPS. HTTP requests will be sent a `301` redirect to corresponding HTTPS resources.\n\n1. Response to every request is sent in [JSON format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). In case the API request results in an error, it is represented by an `\"error\": {}` key in the JSON response.\n\n1. The request method (verb) determines the nature of action you intend to perform. A request made using the `GET` method implies that you want to fetch something from Postman, and `POST` implies you want to save something new to Postman.\n\n1. The API calls will respond with appropriate [HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) for all requests. Within Postman Client, when a response is received, the status code is highlighted and is accompanied by a help text that indicates the possible meaning of the response code. A `200 OK` indicates all went well, while `4XX` or `5XX` response codes indicate an error from the requesting client or our API servers respectively.\n\n1. Individual resources in your Postman Account is accessible using its unique id (`uid`). The `uid` is a simple concatenation of the resource owner's user-id and the resource-id. For example, a collection's `uid` is `{{owner_id}}-{{collection_id}}`.\n\n# Authentication\n\nAn API Key is required to be sent as part of every request to the Postman API, in the form of an `X-Api-Key` request header.\n\n> If you do not have an API Key, you can easily generate one by heading over to the [Postman Integrations Dashboard](https://go.postman.co/integrations/services/pm_pro_api).\n\nAn API Key tells our API server that the request it received came from you. Everything that you have access to in Postman is accessible with an API Key that is generated by you.\n\nFor ease of use inside Postman, you could store your API key in an [environment variable](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/environments) called `postman_api_key` and this [Collection](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections) will automatically use it to make API calls.\n\n## API Key related error response\n\nIf an API Key is missing, malformed, or invalid, you will receive a `401 Unauthorised` response code and the following JSON response:\n\n```\n{\n  \"error\": { \n    \"name\": \"AuthenticationError\",\n    \"message\": \"API Key missing. Every request requires an API Key to be sent.\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Using the API Key as a query parameter\n\nEvery request that accepts API Key as `X-Api-Key` request header, also accepts the key when sent as `apikey` URL query parameter.\n\nAPI key sent as part of the header has a higher priority in case you send the key using both request header and query parameter.\n\n\n# Rate Limits\n\nAPI access rate limits are applied at a per-key basis in unit time. Access to the API using a key is limited to **60 requests per minute**. In addition, every API response is accompanied by the following set of headers to identify the status of your consumption.\n\n\n| Header                  | Description |\n|-------------------------|-------------|\n| `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make per minute. |\n| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window. |\n| `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds. |\n\n\nOnce you hit the rate limit, you will receive a response similar to the following JSON, with a status code of `429 Too Many Requests`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"name\": \"rateLimitError\",\n    \"message\": \"Rate Limit exceeded. Please retry at 1465452702843\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n# Support\n\nFor help regarding accessing the Postman API, feel free to discuss it in our [Discourse Community](https://community.getpostman.com). You can also drop in a line at [help@getpostman.com](mailto:help@getpostman.com).\n\nIn the event you receive a `503` response from our servers, it implies that we have hit an unexpected spike in API access traffic and would usually be operational within the next 5 minutes. If the outage persists, or your receive any other form of `5XX` error, kindly let us know.\n\n\n# Terms of Use\n\nFor information on API terms of use and privacy, refer to our terms at [http://postman.com/legal/terms/](http://postman.com/legal/terms/) and our privacy policy at [https://www.postman.com/legal/privacy-policy/](https://www.postman.com/legal/privacy-policy/).\n\n\n# API Reference"

      description: "This endpoint allows you to update a workspace and update it's association to entities like `collections`, `environments`, `mocks` and `monitors` using their `uid`.\n\nOn successful updation of the workspace, the response returns the workspcae `name` and `id`.\n\n> Requires <a href=\"#authentication\">API Key</a> as `X-Api-Key` request header or `apikey` URL query parameter.\n\n**Note** : The endpoint expects you to send the desired state of the workspace in terms of the associated entities so be careful when trying to update these entities.\n\nFor eg. if your workspace has collections A and B, and in the update call, you send C's uid in the collections array, then A and B would be removed from the workspace and C would be added."

    description: "> __[Provisioning with SCIM is only available to Postman Enterprise teams.](https://www.postman.com/pricing)__\n\nPostman supports [SCIM](http://www.simplecloud.info/) (System for Cross-domain Identity Management), allowing you to automate provisioning and de-provisioning for your team. With this feature, you can efficiently deploy Postman at scale across your organization and control access to it via your identity provider.\n\nYou must be a [Postman team admin](http://learning.getpostman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) to enable SCIM for your team.\n\n# Enabling SCIM Provisioning in Postman\n\nYou must [configure SSO](https://learning.postman.com/docs/administration/sso/admin-sso/) and [enable SCIM](http://learning.getpostman.com/docs/administration/managing-your-team/configuring-scim/#enabling-scim-provisioning) for your Postman team to make use of the SCIM 2.0 API for provisioning and de-provisioning.\n\n> To use SCIM, you must have only one SSO method configured. If you have more than one SSO method enabled, you will not have the option to generate a SCIM API key."
  - name: User Provisioning
    description: "The following SCIM provisioning features are supported:\n\n* **Fetch User Resource**: Fetches individual Postman team member's information.\n\n* **Fetch All User Resource**: Fetches information on all Postman team members. You can fetch information for a particular user using filters.\n\n* **Create User**: Creates a new user account in Postman, adds the account to your organization's Postman team, and activates authentication for the user, provided an account with the same email ID that does not already exist in Postman. If an account with the same email ID does exist, an [email invite](https://learning.postman.com/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#invites) to join your Postman team is sent to the user. Once the user accepts the email invite, they will be added to your team.\n\n  > The newly added user will have the `developer` role in Postman by default. You can later [update account roles in Postman](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#managing-roles).\n\n* **Update User Information**: \n  * **Update User Attributes**: Updates a user’s first and last name in Postman.\n  * **Activate User**: Creates a new user on your Postman team, if one does not already exist, and activates the user to authenticate into your Postman team.\n  * **Deactivate User**: Removes a user from your Postman team and deactivates their account, blocking the account from authenticating into Postman.\n  > The user account and the data corresponding to it will not be deleted. To permanently delete the user account and their data, [contact Postman support](https://www.postman.com/support/).\n  * **Reactivate User**: Reactivates an existing deactivated user by unblocking the account from authenticating into Postman and adds the user back in to your Postman team.\n\nThe base URL for all calls to the SCIM 2.0 API is `https://api.getpostman.com/scim/v2/`.\n\n## Team Level Rate Limits\nFor your organization’s Postman team, Postman applies per minute rate limits across all SCIM API endpoints to ensure you have the best experience while using Postman’s SCIM API.\n\n| Endpoint set                  | Limit (requests per minute)  |\n|:-----------------------------:|:----------------------------:|\n| Writes: POST, PUT, PATCH      | 180                          |\n| Reads: GET                    | 300                          |\n\n## User Attributes\nUser attributes are the information linked to a user’s account. This includes details like name, username, email, password, profile and cover picture, etc. \n\nOnly updates made to the user’s given and family name via the SCIM API will be pushed to Postman. No other user attributes can be updated in Postman using the SCIM API.\n\n| Postman’s Profile Field | SCIM Attribute          | Attribute Type | Required |\n|:-----------------------:|:-----------------------:|:--------------:|:-------: |\n| Email                   | userName                | Singular       | True     |\n| Name                    | {givenName, familyName} | Singular       | True     |\n\n\n## SCIM Provisioning Limitations\n* Users cannot be permanently deleted from Postman via the SCIM API, they can only be deactivated.\n* New users created with the SCIM API will also be created in Postman and added to the Postman team corresponding to the organization, provided an account with the same email ID does not already exist in Postman. If an account with the same email ID does exist, an [email invite](https://learning.postman.com/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#invites) to join your Postman team is sent to the user. Once the user accepts the email invite, they will be added to your team.\n* The newly added user will have the developer role in Postman by default. Postman user roles cannot be updated via the SCIM API, and you must [manage roles in Postman](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#managing-roles).\n* The SCIM API is rate limited. If your requests are being limited, an HTTP: 429 error will be returned.\n* Only updates made to the user’s given and family name through SCIM API will be pushed to Postman. No other user attributes can be updated in Postman using the SCIM API.\n* Only one custom SSO method should be enabled for your Postman team to be able to generate a SCIM API key and use the SCIM feature."
