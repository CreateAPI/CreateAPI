  - name: Audit Log API
    description: >-
      Asana's Audit Log is an immutable log of [important events](/docs/supported-auditlogevents)
      in your organization's Asana instance.


      The Audit Log API allows you to monitor and act upon important security
      and compliance-related changes. Organizations might use this API endpoint to:
      


      * Set up proactive alerting with a Security Information and Event Management
      (SIEM) tool like [Splunk](https://asana.com/guide/help/api/splunk)

      * Conduct reactive investigations when a security incident takes place

      * Visualize key domain data in aggregate to identify security trends


      Note that since the API provides insight into what is happening in an Asana
      instance, the data is [read-only](/docs/get-audit-log-events). That is, there
      are no "write" or "update" endpoints for audit log events.


      Only [Service Accounts](https://asana.com/guide/help/premium/service-accounts)
      in [Enterprise Domains](https://asana.com/enterprise) can access Audit Log API
      endpoints. Authentication with a Service Account's
      [Personal Access Token](/docs/personal-access-token) is required.


      For a full list of
      supported events, see [Supported AuditLogEvents](/docs/supported-auditlogevents).
  - name: Batch API
    description: >-
      There are many cases where you want to accomplish a variety of work in
      the Asana API but want to minimize the number of HTTP requests you make.
      For example:


      * Modern browsers limit the number of requests that a single web page can
        make at once.
      * Mobile apps will use more battery life to keep the cellular radio on
        when making a series of requests.
      * There is an overhead cost to developing software that can make multiple
        requests in parallel.
      * Some cloud platforms handle parallelism poorly, or disallow it
        entirely.


      To make development easier in these use cases, Asana provides a **batch
      API** that enables developers to perform multiple “actions” by making
      only a single HTTP request.


      #### Making a Batch Request


      To make a batch request, send a `POST` request to `/batch`. Like other
      `POST` endpoints, the body should contain a `data` envelope. Inside this
      envelope should be a single `actions` field, containing a list of
      “action” objects.  Each action represents a standard request to an
      existing endpoint in the Asana API.


      **The maximum number of actions allowed in a single batch request is 10**.
      Making a batch request with no actions in it will result in a `400 Bad
      Request`.


      When the batch API receives the list of actions to execute, it will
      dispatch those actions to the already-implemented endpoints specified by
      the `relative_path` and `method` for each action. This happens in
      parallel, so all actions in the request will be processed simultaneously.
      There is no guarantee of the execution order for these actions, nor is
      there a way to use the output of one action as the input of another
      action (such as creating a task and then commenting on it).


      The response to the batch request will contain (within the `data`
      envelope) a list of result objects, one for each action. The results are
      guaranteed to be in the same order as the actions in the request, e.g.,
      the first result in the response corresponds to the first action in the
      request.


      The batch API will always attempt to return a `200 Success` response with
      individual result objects for each individual action in the request. Only
      in certain cases (such as missing authorization or malformed JSON in the
      body) will the entire request fail with another status code. Even if
      every individual action in the request fails, the batch API will still
      return a `200 Success` response, and each result object in the response
      will contain the errors encountered with each action.


      #### Rate Limiting


      The batch API fully respects all of our rate limiting. This means that a
      batch request counts against *both* the standard rate limiter and the
      concurrent request limiter as though you had made a separate HTTP request
      for every individual action. For example, a batch request with five
      actions counts as five separate requests in the standard rate limiter,
      and counts as five concurrent requests in the concurrent request limiter.
      The batch request itself incurs no cost.


      If any of the actions in a batch request would exceed any of the enforced
      limits, the *entire* request will fail with a `429 Too Many Requests`
      error. This is to prevent the unpredictability of which actions might
      succeed if not all of them could succeed.


      #### Restrictions


      Not every endpoint can be accessed through the batch API.
      Specifically, the following actions cannot be taken and will result in a
      `400 Bad Request` for that action:


      * Uploading attachments

      * Creating, getting, or deleting organization exports

      * Any SCIM operations

      * Nested calls to the batch API
  - name: Custom Fields
    description: >-
      In the Asana application, Tasks, Projects, and Portfolios can hold
      user-specified Custom Fields which provide extra information; for example,
      a priority value or a number representing the time required to complete a
      Task. This lets a user define the type of information that each Item
      within a Project or Portfolio can contain in addition to the built-in
      fields that Asana provides.


      **Note:** Custom Fields are a premium feature. Integrations which work
      with Custom Fields need to handle an assortment of use cases for free and
      premium users in context of free and premium organizations. For a detailed
      examination of to what data users will have access in different
      circumstances, read the section below on access control.


      `display_value` is a read-only field that will always be a string. For apps
      that use custom fields, this is a great way to safely display/export the
      value of a custom field, regardless of its type. We suggest apps use
      this field in order to future-proof for changes to Custom Fields.


      The characteristics of Custom Fields are:


      * There is metadata that defines the Custom Field. This metadata can be
      shared across an entire workspace, or be specific to a Project or Portfolio.

      * Creating a Custom Field Setting on a Project or Portfolio means each direct
      child will have the custom field. This is conceptually akin to adding
      columns in a database or a spreadsheet:
      every Task (row) in the Project (table) can contain information for that
      field, including "blank" values, i.e. `null` data. For Portfolio custom
      fields, every Project (row) in the Portfolio (table) will contain
      information for the custom field.

      * Custom Field Settings only go one child deep. Meaning a custom field
      setting on a portfolio will give each project the custom field, but not
      each task within those projects.

      * Tasks have Custom Field _values_ assigned to them.


      A brief example: let's imagine that an organization has defined a Custom
      Field for "Priority". This field is of `enum` type and can have
      user-defined values of `Low`, `Medium`, or `High`. This is the field
      metadata, and it is visible within, and shared across, the entire
      organization.


      A Project is then created in the organization, called "Bugs", and the
      "Priority" Custom Field is associated with that Project. This will allow
      all Tasks within the "Bugs" Project to have an associated "Priority".


      A new Task is created within "Bugs". This Task, then, has a field named
      "Priority" which can take on the Custom Field value of one of `[null]`,
      `Low`, `Medium`, and `High`.


      These Custom Fields are accessible via the API through a number of
      endpoints at the top level (e.g. `/custom_fields` and
      `/custom_field_settings`) and through calls on Workspaces, Portfolios,
      Projects, and
      Tasks resources. The API also provides a way to fetch both the metadata
      and data which define each particular Custom Field, so that a client
      application may render proper UI to display or edit the values.


      Custom Field aware integrations need to be aware of the basic types that
      Custom Fields can adopt. These types are:


      * `text` - an arbitrary, relatively short string of text

      * `number` - a number with a defined level of precision

      * `enum` - a selection from a defined list of options


      Text fields are currently limited to 1024 characters. On Tasks, their
      Custom Field value will have a `text_value` property to represent this
      field.


      Number fields can have an arbitrary `precision` associated with them; for
      example, a precision of `2` would round its value to the second
      (hundredths) place, i.e. 1.2345 would round to 1.23. On Tasks, the Custom
      Field value will have a `number_value` property to represent this field.


      Enum fields represent a selection from a list of options. On the metadata,
      they will contain all of the options in an array. Each option has 4
      properties:


      * `gid` - the gid of this enum option. Note that this is the gid of the
      _option_ - the Custom Field itself has a separate `gid`.

      * `name` - the name of the option, e.g. "Choice #1"

      * `enabled` - whether this field is enabled. Disabled fields are not
      available to choose from when disabled, and are visually hidden in the
      Asana application, but they remain in the metadata for Custom Field values
      which were set to the option before the option was disabled.

      * `color` - a color associated with this choice.


      On the Task's Custom Field value, the enum will have an `enum_value`
      property which will be the same as one of the choices from the list
      defined in the Custom Field metadata.


      #### Querying an organization for its Custom Fields


      For Custom Fields shared across the workspace or organization, the
      Workspace [can be queried](/docs/get-a-workspace-39-s-custom-fields)
      for its list of defined Custom Fields. Like other collection queries, the
      fields will be returned as a compact record; slightly different from most
      other compact records is the fact that the compact record for Custom Fields
      includes `type` as well as `gid` and `name`.


      #### Accessing Custom Field definitions


      The [Custom Fields](/docs/get-a-custom-field) reference
      describes how the metadata which defines a Custom Field is accessed. A
      GET request with a `gid` can be issued on the `/custom_fields` endpoint
      to fetch the full definition of a single Custom Field given its `gid`
      from (for instance) listing all Custom Fields on a Workspace, or getting
      the `gid` from a Custom Field Settings object or a Task.


      #### Associating Custom Fields with a Project or Portfolio


      A mapping between a Custom Field and a Project or Portfolio is handled with
      a
      [Custom Field Settings](/docs/asana-custom-field-settings) object. This object
      contains a reference for each
      of the Custom Field and the Project or Porfolio, as well as additional information
      about the status of that particular Custom Field. For
      instance, `is_important`, which defines whether or not the custom field
      will appear in the list/grid on the Asana application.


      #### Accessing Custom Field values on Tasks or Projects


      The [Tasks](/docs/get-a-task) reference has information on how Custom Fields
      look on Tasks. Custom Fields will return as an array on the
      property `custom_fields`, and each entry will contain, side-by-side, the
      compact representation of the Custom Field metadata and a
      `{typename}_value` property that stores the value set for the
      Custom Field.


      Of particular note is that the top-level `gid` of each entry in the
      `custom_fields` array is the `gid` of the Custom Field metadata, as it is
      the compact representation of this metadata. This can be used to refer to
      the full metadata by making a request to the
      `/custom_fields/{custom_fields_id}` endpoint as described above.


      Custom Fields can be set just as in the Asana-defined fields on a task via
      POST or PUT requests. You can see an example on the
      [update a task](/docs/update-a-task) endpoint.


      Custom Fields on projects follow this same pattern.


      #### Warning: Program defensively with regards to Custom Field definitions


      Asana application users have the ability to change the definitions of
      Custom Field metadata. This means that as you write scripts or
      applications to work with them, it's possible for the definitions to
      change at any time, which may cause an application using them to break or
      malfunction if it makes assumptions about the metadata for a particular
      Custom Field. When using Custom Fields, it is a good idea to program
      *defensively*, meaning you your application should double-check that
      the Custom Field metadata is what it expects.


      Storing the state of the Custom Field metadata for too long if you
      dynamically create a model for it can cause your model to become
      unsynchronized with the model stored in Asana. If you encounter
      (for example) an `enum` value on a Task that does not match any option
      in your metadata model, your metadata model has become out of date with
      the Custom Field metadata.


      **Note:** We are currently studying proposals for future implementations
      to more elegantly handle the modification of Custom Field metadata for
      application integrations.


      #### Enabled and Disabled Values


      When information that is contained in a Custom Field value loses a
      logical association with its metadata definition, the value becomes
      disabled. This can happen in a couple of simple ways, for example, if
      you remove the Custom Field metadata from a Project, or move a Task with
      a Custom Field to a different Project which does not have the Custom
      Field metadata associated with it. The value remains on the Task, and
      the Custom Field metadata can still be found and examined, but as the
      context in which the Custom Field makes sense is gone, the Custom Field
      cannot change its value; it can only be cleared.


      Note: Tasks that are associated with multiple Projects do not become
      disabled, so long as at least one of the Projects is still associated
      with the Custom Field metadata. In other words, Tasks with multiple
      Projects will retain logically associated to the set of Custom Field
      metadata represented by all of their Projects.


      Moving the Task back under a Project with that Custom Field applied to it
      or applying the Custom Field metadata to the current Project will return
      the Custom Field value to an enabled state. In this scenario, the Custom
      Field will be re-enabled and editable again.


      In the Asana application, disabled fields are grayed out and not allowed
      to change, other than to be discarded. In the API, we return a property
      `enabled: false` to inform the external application that the value has
      been disabled.


      Note that the API enforces the same operations on disabled Custom Field
      values as hold in the Asana application: they may not have their values
      changed, since the lack of context for the values of a custom field in
      general doesn't provide enough information to know what new values should
      be. Setting the Custom Field value to `null` will clear and remove the
      Custom Field value from the Task.


      #### Custom Field access control


      Custom Fields are a complex feature of the Asana platform, and their
      access in the Asana application and in the API vary based on the status
      of the user and project. When building your application, it's best to be
      defensive and not assume the given user will have read or write access
      to a custom field, and fail gracefully when this occurs.
  - name: Custom Field Settings
    description: >-
      Custom fields are attached to a particular project with the Custom
      Field Settings resource. This resource both represents the
      many-to-many join of the Custom Field and Project as well as stores
      information that is relevant to that particular pairing; for instance,
      the `is_important` property determines some possible
      application-specific handling of that custom field.
  - name: Events
    description: >-
      *Note: The Events architecture uses the same infrastructure as Webhooks. That
      is, the two
      resources differ only in the delivery mechanism for events (i.e., pull vs. push).
      Recently,
      some users have seen intermittent delays with event distributions. For more
      information,
      see [Webhooks](/docs/webhooks).*


      An *event* is an object representing a change to a resource that was
      observed by an event subscription.


      In general, requesting events on a resource is faster and subject to
      higher rate limits than requesting the resource itself. Additionally,
      change events bubble up - listening to events on a project would include
      when stories are added to tasks in the project, even on subtasks.


      Establish an initial sync token by making a request with no sync token.
      The response will be a `412` error - the same as if the sync token had
      expired.


      Subsequent requests should always provide the sync token from the
      immediately preceding call.


      Sync tokens may not be valid if you attempt to go ‘backward’ in the
      history by requesting previous tokens, though re-requesting the current
      sync token is generally safe, and will always return the same results.


      When you receive a `412 Precondition Failed` error, it means that the
      sync token is either invalid or expired. If you are attempting to keep a
      set of data in sync, this signals you may need to re-crawl the data.


      Sync tokens always expire after 24 hours, but may expire sooner,
      depending on load on the service.
  - name: Goals
    description: >-
      A `goal` is an object in the goal-tracking system that helps your organization
      drive measurable results.
  - name: Jobs
    description: >-
      Jobs represent processes that handle asynchronous work.

      Jobs are created when an endpoint requests an action that will be handled
      asynchronously. Such as project or task duplication.

      Only the creator of the duplication process can access the duplication
      status
      of the new object.
  - name: Organization Exports
    description: >-
      An *organization_export* object represents a request to export the
      complete data of an Organization in JSON format.


      To export an Organization using this API:


      * Create an `organization_export`
        [request](/docs/create-an-organization-export-request)
        and store the id that is returned.
      * Request the `organization_export` every few minutes, until the
        `state` field contains ‘finished’.
      * Download the file located at the URL in the `download_url` field.
      * Exports can take a long time, from several minutes to a few hours
        for large Organizations.


      *Note: These endpoints are only available to [Service
      Accounts](https://asana.com/guide/help/premium/service-accounts) of an
      [Enterprise](https://asana.com/enterprise) Organization.*
  - name: Portfolios
    description: >-
      A `portfolio` gives a high-level overview of the status of multiple
      initiatives in Asana. Portfolios provide a dashboard overview of the
      state of multiple projects, including a progress report and the most
      recent [project status](/docs/asana-project-statuses)
      update.

      Portfolios have some restrictions on size. Each portfolio has a max of 250
      items and, like projects, a max of 20 custom fields.
  - name: Portfolio Memberships
    description: >-
      This object determines if a user is a member of a portfolio.
  - name: Projects
    description: >-
      A `project` represents a prioritized list of tasks in Asana or a board
      with columns of tasks represented as cards. It exists in a single
      workspace or organization and is accessible to a subset of users in that
      workspace or organization, depending on its permissions.


      Projects in organizations are shared with a single team. You cannot
      currently change the team of a project via the API. Non-organization
      workspaces do not have teams and so you should not specify the team of
      project in a regular workspace.


      Followers of a project are a subset of the members of that project.
      Followers of a project will receive all updates including tasks
      created, added and removed from that project. Members of the project
      have access to and will receive status updates of the project. Adding
      followers to a project will add them as members if they are not
      already, removing followers from a project will not affect membership.
  - name: Project Memberships
    description: >-
      With the introduction of “comment-only” projects in Asana, a user’s
      membership in a project comes with associated permissions. These
      permissions (whether a user has full access to the project or
      comment-only access) are accessible through the project memberships
      endpoints described here.
  - name: Project Statuses
    description: >-
      A *project status* is an update on the progress of a particular project,
      and is sent out to all project followers when created. These updates
      include both text describing the update and a color code intended to
      represent the overall state of the project: "green" for projects that
      are on track, "yellow" for projects at risk, "red" for projects that
      are behind, and "blue" for projects on hold.


      Project statuses can be created and deleted, but not modified.
  - name: Sections
    description: >-
      A *section* is a subdivision of a project that groups tasks together.
      It can either be a header above a list of tasks in a list view or a
      column in a board view of a project.


      Sections are largely a shared idiom in Asana’s API for both list and
      board views of a project regardless of the project’s layout.


      The ‘memberships’ property when
      [getting a task](/docs/get-a-task)
      will return the information for the section or the column under
      ‘section’ in the response.
  - name: Stories
    description: >-
      *See [our forum post](https://forum.asana.com/t/no-more-parsing-story-text-new-fields-on-stories/42924)
      for more info on when conditional fields are returned.*


      A *story* represents an activity associated with an object in the
      Asana system. Stories are generated by the system whenever users take
      actions such as creating or assigning tasks, or moving tasks between
      projects. *Comments* are also a form of user-generated story.
  - name: Tags
    description: >-
      A tag is a label that can be attached to any task in Asana. It exists in
      a single workspace or organization.


      Tags have some metadata associated with them, but it is possible that
      we will simplify them in the future so it is not encouraged to rely
      too heavily on it. Unlike projects, tags do not provide any ordering
      on the tasks they are associated with.
  - name: Tasks
    description: >-
      The task is the basic object around which many operations in Asana are
      centered. In the Asana application, multiple tasks populate the

      Sections are unique in that they will be included in the *memberships*
      field of task objects returned in the API when the task is within a
      section. They can also be used to manipulate the ordering of a task
      within a project.

      *Note: Recently, some users have seen intermittent delays with webhook event
      distributions. We are
      in the process of transferring the webhooks system to a more reliable infrastructure
      while also
      iteratively improving the current system. As such, for the time being we advise
      against using
      webhooks for functionality beyond logging (e.g., syncing state with real-time
      notification data).
      If you experience issues, we recommend using webhooks in conjunction with fetching
      the resource
      periodically (e.g. [GET a task](/docs/get-a-task)). More details and ongoing
      updates can be found in
      [this post](https://forum.asana.com/t/update-on-upcoming-improvements-to-our-webhooks-system/143305)
      in the developer forum.*


      Webhooks allow an application to be notified of changes in Asana.


      This is similar to our [Events](/docs/asana-events) resource, but webhooks
      "push" events via HTTP `POST` rather than expecting integrations to
      repeatedly "poll" for them. For services that are already accessible on
      the Internet this is often more convenient and efficient.


      However, webhooks _require_ a server to be accessible over the internet at
      all times to receive the event. For most simple integrations, Events
      provide much of the same benefits while using a significantly simpler
      implementation which does not require maintaining an internet-accessible
      server.


      #### The webhook "handshake"

      In order to ensure that the receiving server is available to receive
      incoming events from a webhook Asana will `POST` to the requested target
      endpoint during the webhook creation request. In other words, the
      outgoing webhook creation request will wait to return until another full
      `POST` request from Asana's servers to the target has been completed, *then*
      the
      webhook creation request can return with a successful response.


      *Note: this means that your server must be able to handle being blocked on
      the outgoing create request while still being able to receive and handle an
      incoming request. A common reason that webhook handshakes fail is that
      servers are not able to asynchronously handle the handshake request.*


      Included in the webhook handshake is a HTTP header called
      `X-Hook-Secret`.  To successfully complete the handshake the receiving
      server should echo back the same header with the same value and a `200
      OK` or `204 No Content` response code.


      The purpose of this header is to provide a shared secret that both Asana
      and the receiving server both store--this is the only time it will be
      transmitted. In future webhook events Asana will use this key to compute
      a signature over the webhook callback request's body which can be used to
      verify that the incoming request was genuine (details below). We strongly
      recommend that you take advantage of this security feature and reject
      webhooks that have an invalid signature.


      #### Receiving Events


      Because multiple events often happen in short succession, a webhook
      payload is designed to be able to transmit multiple events at once. The
      schema of these events is described in [Event](/docs/tocS_Event).


      The HTTP POST that the target receives contains:


       * An `X-Hook-Signature` header, which allows verifying that the payload
       is genuine.  The signature is a SHA256 HMAC signature computed on the
       request body using the shared secret transmitted during the handshake.
       Verification is **strongly recommended**, as it would otherwise be
       possible for an attacker to POST a malicious payload to the same
       endpoint.
       * A JSON body with a single key, `events`, containing an array of the
       events that have occurred since the last webhook delivery. (Note that this
       list may be empty, as periodically we send a "heartbeat" webhook to
       verify that the endpoint is still available.)


      Note that events are "skinny" and contain only some basic details of the
      change, not the whole resource. We expect integrations to make additional
      calls to the API to retrieve the latest state from Asana.


      #### Filtering

      Webhook events will "propagate up" from contained objects through to
      parent objects--for instance, changes to comments will be sent to
      webhooks on the parent task and to ones on the task's projects. In this
      way a webhook on a project will be notified of all changes that occur in
      all of its tasks, subtasks of those tasks, and comments on those tasks
      and subtasks.


      This can be a lot of data, some of which might not be relevant to a
      particular integration, so Asana's webhooks have a filtering feature
      which allows integrations to specify only the types of changes that they
      care about. By specifying the list of
      [WebhookFilter](/docs/tocS_WebhookFilter)s on webhook creation an integration
      can select just the subset of events it wants to receive.  When filters
      are specified on the webhook events will only be delivered if they pass
      any of the filters specified when creating the webhook.


      To reduce the volume of data to transfer, webhooks created on teams,
      portfolios, and workspaces *must* specify filters. In addition, the set of
      event filters that can be placed on a team-level or workspace-level
      webhook is more limited than filters for webhooks that are created on
      lower-level resources:


       * Webhook events from tasks, subtasks, and stories won't be propagated
       to these higher-level webhooks, so all changes on these resources are
       automatically filtered out.
       * Webhook events from `project` resources can be filtered for these
       `action`s: `added`, `removed`, `deleted`, `undeleted`, and `changed`.
       * Webhook events from `team_membership` resources can be filtered to
       `action`s `added` and `removed`.
       * Webhook events from `workspace_membership` resources can be filtered
       to `added` and `removed`.


      #### Error Handling and Retry


      If we attempt to send a webhook payload and we receive an error status
      code, or the request times out, we will retry delivery with exponential
      backoff. In general, if your servers are not available for an hour, you
      can expect it to take no longer than approximately an hour after they come
      back before the paused delivery resumes. However, if we are unable to
      deliver a message for 24 hours the webhook will be deactivated.

      #### Webhook Heartbeat Events

      Webhooks keep track of the last time that delivery succeeded, and this time
      is updated with each success. To help facilitate this, webhooks have a “heartbeat”
      that will deliver an empty payload at the initial handshake, and then every
      eight hours. This way, even if there is no activity on the resource, the last
      success time (i.e `last_success_at`) will still be updated continuously.

      #### Resources and Actions

      This is not an exhaustive list, but should cover the most common use
      cases.


       * Attachment - deleted, undeleted
       * Portfolio - added, deleted, removed
       * Project - added, changed, deleted, removed, undeleted
       * Project Membership - added, removed
       * Section - added, changed, deleted, undeleted
       * Story - added, removed, undeleted
       * Tag - added, changed, deleted, undeleted
       * Task - added, changed, deleted, removed, undeleted
       * Team - added, changed, deleted
       * Team Membership - added, removed
       * Workspace - added, removed, changed
       * Workspace Memberships - added, removed


      #### Webhook Limits


      Webhooks have two different limits

       * 1k limit per resource in Asana. (If 10 apps each have 100 webhooks
         watching the same resource, no more webhooks can be placed on the
         webhook. `/events` streams count towards this limit)
       * 10k per user-app (An app can have 10k webhooks for EACH user)

      #### Example Integration: Webhook Inspector

      The [Webhook Inspector](https://github.com/Asana/devrel-examples/tree/master/python/webhooks)
      is a Python script that demonstrates the features of Asana webhooks, including
      how to both properly set them up and receive them. By using this script, you
      can create a webhook and log the contents of incoming notifications to your
      console.

      To use this demo, be sure to generate a new [personal access token](https://developers.asana.com/docs/personal-access-token),
      then follow the instructions in README.
  - name: Workspaces
    description: >-
      A *workspace* is the highest-level organizational unit in Asana. All
      projects and tasks have an associated workspace.


      An *organization* is a special kind of workspace that represents a
      company. In an organization, you can group your projects into teams.
      You can read more about how organizations work on the Asana Guide. To
      tell if your workspace is an organization or not, check its
      `is_organization` property.


      Over time, we intend to migrate most workspaces into organizations and
      to release more organization-specific functionality. We may eventually
      deprecate using workspace-based APIs for organizations. Currently, and
      until after some reasonable grace period following any further
      announcements, you can still reference organizations in any
      `workspace` parameter.

    GenericErrorResponse:
      description: >-
        Sadly, sometimes requests to the API are not successful. Failures can
        occur for a wide range of reasons. In all cases, the API should return
        an HTTP Status Code that indicates the nature of the failure,
        with a response body in JSON format containing additional information.
        In the event of a server error the response body will contain an error
        phrase. These phrases are automatically generated using the
        [node-asana-phrase
        library](https://github.com/Asana/node-asana-phrase) and can be used by
        Asana support to quickly look up the incident that caused the server
        error.

            Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field can
            adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum option but no
            more than 50.


            You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST
            /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options` endpoint.


            **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead,
            enum options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to false
            with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint. Other
            attributes can be updated similarly.


            On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`,
            meaning the enum option is a selectable value for the custom field.
            Setting `enabled=false` is equivalent to “trashing” the enum option in
            the Asana web app within the “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum option
            will no longer be selectable but, if the enum option value was
            previously set within a task, the task will retain the value.


            Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options are
            inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum options can
            be specified on creation by using `insert_before` or `insert_after` to
            reference an existing enum option. Only one of `insert_before` and
            `insert_after` can be provided when creating a new enum option.


            An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST
            /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert` endpoint.

    EventResponse:
      description: |-
        An *event* is an object representing a change to a resource that was
        observed by an event subscription or delivered asynchronously to
        the target location of an active webhook.

        The event may be triggered by a different `user` than the
        subscriber. For example, if user A subscribes to a task and user B
        modified it, the event’s user will be user B. Note: Some events
        are generated by the system, and will have `null` as the user. API
        consumers should make sure to handle this case.

        The `resource` that triggered the event may be different from the one
        that the events were requested for or the webhook is subscribed to. For
        example, a subscription to a project will contain events for tasks
        contained within the project.

        **Note:** pay close attention to the relationship between the fields
        `Event.action` and `Event.change.action`.
        `Event.action` represents the action taken on the resource
        itself, and `Event.change.action` represents how the information
        within the resource's fields have been modified.

        For instance, consider these scenarios:


        * When at task is added to a project, `Event.action` will be
        `added`, `Event.parent` will be on object with the `id` and
        `type` of the project, and there will be no `change` field.


        * When an assignee is set on the task, `Event.parent` will be
        `null`, `Event.action` will be `changed`,
        `Event.change.action` will be `changed`, and `changed_value` will
        be an object with the user's `id` and `type`.


        * When a collaborator is added to the task, `Event.parent` will
        be `null`, `Event.action` will be `changed`,
        `Event.change.action` will be `added`, and `added_value` will be
        an object with the user's `id` and `type`.

        Upload an attachment.

        This method uploads an attachment to a task and returns the compact
        record for the created attachment object. This is possible by either:

        - Providing the URL of the external resource being attached, or
        - Downloading the file content first and then uploading it as any other attachment. Note that it is not possible to attach
        files from third party services such as Dropbox, Box, Vimeo & Google Drive via the API

        The 100MB size limit on attachments in Asana is enforced on this endpoint.

        This endpoint expects a multipart/form-data encoded request containing
        the full contents of the file to be uploaded.

        Requests made should follow the HTTP/1.1 specification that line
        terminators are of the form `CRLF` or `\r\n` outlined
        [here](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.1/draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-01#Basic-Rules)
        in order for the server to reliably and properly handle the request.

      summary: Get audit log events
      description: >-
        Retrieve the audit log events that have been captured in your domain.


        This endpoint will return a list of [AuditLogEvent](/docs/audit-log-event)
        objects,
        sorted by creation time in ascending order. Note that the Audit Log API captures
        events
        from October 8th, 2021 and later. Queries for events before this date will
        not return
        results.


        There are a number of query parameters (below) that can be used to filter
        the set of
        [AuditLogEvent](/docs/audit-log-event) objects that are returned in the response.
        Any
        combination of query parameters is valid. When no filters are provided, all
        of the events
        that have been captured in your domain will match.


        The list of events will always be [paginated](/docs/pagination). The default
        limit
        is 1000 events. The next set of events can be retrieved using the `offset`
        from the
        previous response. If there are no events that match the provided filters
        in your domain, the endpoint will return `null` for the `next_page` field.
        Querying
        again with the same filters may return new events if they were captured after
        the
        last request. Once a response includes a `next_page` with an `offset`, subsequent
        requests can be made with the latest `offset` to poll for new events that
        match
        the provided filters.


        When no `offset` is provided, the response will begin with the oldest events
        that match the provided filters. It is important to note that
        [AuditLogEvent](/docs/audit-log-event) objects will be permanently deleted
        from our systems
        after 90 days. If you wish to keep a permanent record of these events, we
        recommend using a
        SIEM tool to ingest and store these logs.

        Since custom fields can be defined for one of a number of types, and
        these types have different data and behaviors, there are fields that are
        relevant to a particular type. For instance, as noted above, enum_options
        is only relevant for the enum type and defines the set of choices that
        the enum could represent. The examples below show some of these
        type-specific custom field definitions.

        When using this method, it is best to specify only those fields you wish
        to change, or else you may overwrite changes made by another user since
        you last retrieved the custom field.

        A custom field’s `type` cannot be updated.

        An enum custom field’s `enum_options` cannot be updated with this
        endpoint.
        Instead see “Work With Enum Options” for information on how to update
        `enum_options`.

        Locked custom fields can only be updated by the user who locked the field.

        data block containing the fields you’d like to set on the task. Any

        specified. If no location arguments are given, the task will be added to
        the end of the project.

        `addProject` can also be used to reorder a task within a project or
        section that already contains it.

        At most one of `insert_before`, `insert_after`, or `section` should be
        specified. Inserting into a section in an non-order-dependent way can be
        done by specifying section, otherwise, to insert within a section in a
        particular place, specify `insert_before` or `insert_after` and a task
        within the section to anchor the position of this task.

        Returns an empty data block.

      summary: Search tasks in a workspace
      description: >-
        To mirror the functionality of the Asana web app's advanced search feature,
        the Asana API has a task search endpoint that allows you to build complex
        filters to find and retrieve the exact data you need.

        #### Premium access

        Like the Asana web product's advance search feature, this search endpoint
        will
        only be available to premium Asana users. A user is premium if any of the
        following is true:


        - The workspace in which the search is being performed is a premium workspace
        - The user is a member of a premium team inside the workspace


        Even if a user is only a member of a premium team inside a non-premium
        workspace, search will allow them to find data anywhere in the workspace,
        not just inside the premium team. Making a search request using credentials
        of a non-premium user will result in a `402 Payment Required` error.

        #### Pagination

        Search results are not stable; repeating the same query multiple times may
        return the data in a different order, even if the data do not change. Because
        of this, the traditional [pagination](https://developers.asana.com/docs/#pagination)
        available elsewhere in the Asana API is not available here. However, you can
        paginate manually by sorting the search results by their creation time and
        then
        modifying each subsequent query to exclude data you have already seen. Page
        sizes
        are limited to a maximum of 100 items, and can be specified by the `limit`
        query parameter.

        #### Eventual consistency

        Changes in Asana (regardless of whether they’re made though the web product
        or the API) are forwarded to our search infrastructure to be indexed. This
        process can take between 10 and 60 seconds to complete under normal operation,
        and longer during some production incidents. Making a change to a task that
        would alter its presence in a particular search query will not be reflected
        immediately. This is also true of the advanced search feature in the web product.

        #### Rate limits

        You may receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response if you hit any of our
        [rate limits](https://developers.asana.com/docs/#rate-limits).

        #### Custom field parameters

        | Parameter name | Custom field type | Accepted type |

        |---|---|---|

        | custom_fields.{gid}.is_set | All | Boolean |

        | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Text | String |

        | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Number | Number |

        | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Enum | Enum option ID |

        | custom_fields.{gid}.starts_with | Text only | String |

        | custom_fields.{gid}.ends_with | Text only | String |

        | custom_fields.{gid}.contains | Text only | String |

        | custom_fields.{gid}.less_than | Number only | Number |

        | custom_fields.{gid}.greater_than | Number only | Number |



        For example, if the gid of the custom field is 12345, these query parameter
        to
        find tasks where it is set would be `custom_fields.12345.is_set=true`. To
        match
        an exact value for an enum custom field, use the gid of the desired enum option
        and not the name of the enum option: `custom_fields.12345.value=67890`.


        Searching for multiple exact matches of a custom field is not supported.


        *Note: If you specify `projects.any` and `sections.any`, you will receive
        tasks for the project **and** tasks for the section. If you're looking for
        only tasks in a section, omit the `projects.any` from the request.*

      summary: Get objects via typeahead
      description: |-
        Retrieves objects in the workspace based via an auto-completion/typeahead
        search algorithm. This feature is meant to provide results quickly, so do
        not rely on this API to provide extremely accurate search results. The
        result set is limited to a single page of results with a maximum size, so
        you won’t be able to fetch large numbers of results.

        The typeahead search API provides search for objects from a single
        workspace. This endpoint should be used to query for objects when
        creating an auto-completion/typeahead search feature. This API is meant
        to provide results quickly and should not be relied upon for accurate or
        exhaustive search results. The results sets are limited in size and
        cannot be paginated.

        Queries return a compact representation of each object which is typically
        the gid and name fields. Interested in a specific set of fields or all of
        the fields?! Of course you are. Use field selectors to manipulate what
        data is included in a response.

        Resources with type `user` are returned in order of most contacted to
        least contacted. This is determined by task assignments, adding the user
        to projects, and adding the user as a follower to tasks, messages,
        etc.

        Resources with type `project` are returned in order of recency. This is
        determined when the user visits the project, is added to the project, and
        completes tasks in the project.

        Resources with type `task` are returned with priority placed on tasks
        the user is following, but no guarantee on the order of those tasks.

        Leaving the `query` string empty or omitted will give you results, still
        following the resource ordering above. This could be used to list users or
        projects that are relevant for the requesting user's api token.

        Establish a webhook
      description: |-
        Establishing a webhook is a two-part process. First, a simple HTTP POST
        request initiates the creation similar to creating any other resource.

        Next, in the middle of this request comes the confirmation handshake.
        When a webhook is created, we will send a test POST to the target with an
        `X-Hook-Secret` header. The target must respond with a `200 OK` or `204
        No Content` and a matching `X-Hook-Secret` header to confirm that this
        webhook subscription is indeed expected. We strongly recommend storing
        this secret to be used to verify future webhook event signatures.

        The POST request to create the webhook will then return with the status
        of the request. If you do not acknowledge the webhook’s confirmation
        handshake it will fail to setup, and you will receive an error in
        response to your attempt to create it. This means you need to be able to
        receive and complete the webhook *while* the POST request is in-flight
        (in other words, have a server that can handle requests asynchronously).

        Invalid hostnames like localhost will recieve a 403 Forbidden status code.
